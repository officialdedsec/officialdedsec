Hey Guys Its DedSec, Founder of DedSeec. I spend most of my free time creating content for my YouTube channel and this website. I started my YouTube channel at age 15 and my goal was to teach people what they can do with their gadgets. I gained a substantial amount of subscribers and viewers. Honestly, at the end of the day, itâ€™s my audience who really inspire me. They are the ones watching my content and giving me feedback. Without them, there would be no point in doing YouTube.
